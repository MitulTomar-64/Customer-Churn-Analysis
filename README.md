# Customer Churn and Revenue Impact Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes customer churn behavior in a telecom company to identify key factors contributing to customer attrition and quantify the revenue impact of churn using exploratory data analysis and visualization techniques.

## Business Problem
Customer churn is a major challenge for subscription-based businesses. Losing existing customers leads to revenue loss and increased customer acquisition costs. Understanding why customers leave and how churn impacts revenue is essential for improving retention strategies.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project is the IBM Telco Customer Churn dataset, containing 7,043 customer records and 21 features, including customer demographics, service usage, contract details, billing information, and churn status.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

## Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Handling missing and inconsistent values  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Churn analysis by contract type and customer tenure  
- Revenue impact analysis of customer churn  

## Key Insights
- Customers with month-to-month contracts have the highest churn rate.  
- Churn is significantly higher during early tenure periods.  
- Higher monthly charges are associated with increased churn.  
- A significant portion of monthly revenue is lost due to customer churn.  

## Business Recommendations
- Promote long-term contracts through discounts or loyalty programs.  
- Improve onboarding experience for new customers.  
- Identify and retain high-value customers with personalized offers.  
- Review pricing strategies for customers with higher monthly charges.  

## How to Run the Project
1. Upload the dataset to Google Colab.  
2. Open the notebook `Customer_Churn_Analysis.ipynb`.  
3. Run all cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.
